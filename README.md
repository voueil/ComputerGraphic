# ComputerGraphic
i used my knowledge in computer graphics to build a robot shaped as a cat
the robot design was inspired by the Himalayan one of the group members cat, we chose this animal because it is cute and elegant, and we thought it would be fun to create a robot that looks like my cat, the robot has a rounded body, fluffy tail, cute ears, and big eyes
The development goal was to make the robot move in a fun way, like having the tail swing, the head turn, and the robot walk and jump. We also wanted to create a nice environment with trees, flowers, and the sun to make the scene more lively
